# Noco.io Landing Page Template (001)

Welcome to your Noco.io landing page template!

## Overview

This template provides a clean, modern starting point for a website landing page, built with:

*   **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/):** A popular React framework for building server-rendered or static web applications.
*   **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/):** For smooth, declarative animations.

While Noco.io aims to be like Webflow for building full SaaS applications, **this specific template is focused solely on the landing page UI**. It doesn't include backend functionality or authentication out of the box.

## Using This Template with Noco.io

Noco.io works much like Cursor but in the cloud and focused on templates. You can easily modify this template using AI:

1.  **Chat with the AI:** Simply describe the changes you want to make in the chat panel. Ask it to add sections, change colors, update text, implement animations, or restyle elements.
2.  **Upload Images:** Provide screenshots or mockups of designs you like, and ask the AI to replicate the style or layout.
3.  **Iterate:** Watch the AI apply changes directly to the code. Review the results and provide further instructions to refine the design.

## Project Structure & Creating Pages

*   **Pages:** All website pages are located in the `./pages` directory. The file structure here maps directly to the URL routes.
    *   `./pages/index.js` corresponds to the homepage (`/`).
*   **Creating New Pages:** To add a new page (e.g., `/about`), create a new file like `./pages/about.js`. Then, you can simply ask the Noco AI to generate the UI components and content for that page based on your requirements.
*   **Styles:** Global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration can be found in `./styles/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.js`, respectively. You can ask the AI to modify theme colors, fonts, or add custom CSS here.
*   **Components:** While this template might start simple, you can ask the AI to refactor parts of the pages into reusable React components, often placed in a `./components` directory (you might need to ask the AI to create this).
